**Random program:**
```java
    public static int getRandomNumber() {
        int randomNum = (int)(Math.random()*10);
        System.out.println("random result:" + randomNum);
        return randomNum;
    }
```

```java
    @Test
    public void getRandomNumber() {
        assertTrue(RandomUtil.getRandomNumber() > 5);
